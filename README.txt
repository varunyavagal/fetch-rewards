## Text similarity Fetch-Rewards

## Have tried to write my version of code which checks the similarity of two texts and gives the metric which is defined as jaccard similarity

## Have also written a function which takes stopwords (then, the, a, an, etc) and does not consider those words while calculating jaccard similarity

## I've used flask to create a GUI which shows the jaccard index in a new tab, the URL for the same is written in the last line of the code

## have used jupyter notebook for this program, and for running every line of code, cntrl +enter key can be used.

## To get the Jaccard similarity, I've used the samples provided in the question. So, String1 is the 1st sample, while string2 is the second one
